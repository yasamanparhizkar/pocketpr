"Had an amazing time at GenAI Genesis at UofT from March 21-23! ðŸ¤© As a hacker, I dove headfirst into exploring AI for Human Empowerment, the central theme of the event.\n\nIt was a whirlwind of learning, fun, and connecting with some seriously cool people in the AI space. I walked away with a ton of new insights and a renewed excitement for the possibilities of GenAI.\n\nWere any of you there? Would love to hear your key takeaways and experiences from GenAI Genesis! Share your thoughts in the comments! ðŸ‘‡\n\n#GenAI #AIforHumanEmpowerment #UofT #Hacking #Networking #ArtificialIntelligence #TechEvent #GenAIGenesis"
