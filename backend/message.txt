Attended the GenAI Genesis 2025 event at U of T from March 21-23 and it was fantastic! My goals were to dive into the latest GenAI tools and connect with fellow enthusiasts, and I definitely achieved that. Came away with valuable insights into some cutting-edge agentic AI tools hitting the market. Plus, it was a great opportunity to catch up with friends. Looking forward to seeing how these technologies evolve!
