Thrilled to share my experience at the GenAI Genesis 2025 hackathon held recently at the University of Toronto! It was an incredible opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals and explore the forefront of generative AI. The energy and innovation were truly inspiring. Looking forward to seeing the groundbreaking solutions that emerged.
