Thrilled to share my experience at GenAI Genesis 2025, a fantastic hackathon held at the University of Toronto from March 21-23! It was an incredible opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals and explore the cutting edge of Generative AI. The energy and innovation were truly inspiring. I'm leaving with new knowledge, valuable connections, and a renewed passion for the field. Looking forward to seeing what groundbreaking projects emerge from this talented community!
